Array Buffers are the backend for Typed Arrays. Whereas `Buffer` in Node is both
the raw bytes as well as the encoding/view, Array Buffers are only raw bytes and you
have to create a Typed Array on top of an Array Buffer in order to access the data.

When you create a new Typed Array and don't give it an Array Buffer to be a view
on top of it will create its own new Array Buffer instead.

## Challenge

For this challenge, take the integer from `process.argv[2]` and write it as the first
element in a single-element `Uint32Array`. Then create a `Uint16Array` from the Array
Buffer of the `Uint32Array` and log out to the console the JSON stringified version
of the `Uint16Array`.

Bonus: try to explain the relevance of the integer from `process.argv[2]`, or explain
why the `Uint16Array` has the particular values that it does.

## Hints

Read more about Typed Arrays here:

  http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays

also: JSON.stringify() FTW!

To get output for debugging when running `{appname} run program.js`
you should use `console.error` instead of `console.log`.
